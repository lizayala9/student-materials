## Executive Summary

*Your executive summary should be pretty brief, under 3 paragraphs and should provide a concise summary of the purpose and contents of the rest of the document.  Explain to the reader what they will get from this document.*



We will develop a web application which will allow students to connect with like-minded students around the area for projects.
The idea is for a student to be able to log into a web application and either post an idea for a project or search for other student's ideas to find something they are interested in working on. The students will need the ability to connect with each other and discuss working together. Any options to make the application more social would be valued.

The client values quality and innovative solution or something that is quick to market. They are looking for features that would motivate students to engage in using this platform to connect and build better communication. So in this scenario, social medias will be the sources linked to each indvidual account.

## Business Objectives

The objective is for students to be able to share projects they are currently working on and be able to team up with one or more students in order for collaboration. We want to be able to provide a service in helping students obtain the help or resources needed to complete a project. 

## Background

We previously as students spent restless nights staring at computer monitors, waiting for the "a-ha" moment. This consumed much of our time without productivity. Even in the work place today, we will need a helping hand in order to complete our tasks at a given time. If students can minimize the amount of time being stuck on one project, they can move on to others and gain more experience in the process. 

## Scope

This application shall include a messaging service so that students can communicate in private with other students. Students should be able to post on a feed and write details about there project. Students will have their own profile. There will be a "friends" section involved. Project posts should be order of newest to oldest. 

## Functional requirements


When users create account, it should involve first, last name, and a user id. GET, PUT, POST, DELETE methods should be involved. Students should be able to upload photos and have their own profile involving name, state they live in, an optional occupation/field of study entry, and also a small bio should be allowed (200 letters max). Students should be able to link their social media accounts to their profile. Only retrieve facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn accounts. There should be a message icon near the students profile which will allow you to privately message student. There should be a "home" which will include all the recent posts, a "search" section which can look other students up by name or user id, a "messages" tab where they can create a message to user and see existing messages, and a "profile" tab, allowing students to update their profile. 

## Personnel requirements

*In this section you may want to describe the composition of the team, do you need dedicated development?  how many people?  How about design or QA?  Think about what personnel is required to make this project a success, and place your recommendations here.*

For this project, we are keeping it simple to start and only need about a 10 person team. 1 will be the project manager ensuring everything falls according to schedule, 3 will code the back-end, 3 will code the front-end and 3 will test and alters any issues. Application is to be consisting of soothing colors such as silver blue, gray, off-white's and black. Please exclude using bright colors such as yellow and orange as little as possible. We like color, but subtle. Project timeframe will be about 3 months and if needed 2 additional weeks from them. 

## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*

For the first 3 weeks, we would like to prioritize simplicity in design and functions. Have a plan for HOW things will operate when you land on application pages. For ex: click this, does that. Click that, does this, etc. Know WHERE things will be placed and why. We want a simple operating applications without confusion on how it works. 

For the next 5 weeks, we will implement all functions we want to include in applcation. Ensure every button works, every message sends, and everything is secure. 

The following weeks, we will test and fix any erros that arise. 


## Other requirements

Users should be able to login via PC and mobile phone with similar look and feel. We need a responsive application when in mobile view. 

## Assumptions

*Oftentimes we are reliant on outside sources such as frameworks to be used, or services that our system will depend on.  In this section you should provide detail on any assumptions that you have made, such as the system being reliant on the availability of the Google Maps API.*

Should have availability to link to the 3 social media accounts listed above. Should be able to share links. Google maps not neccessary. 

## Limitations

Because there is no overlap (by design), each phase is dependent on thorough completion of the prior phase. The Waterfall method makes the assumption that all requirements can be gathered up front and thoroughly documented. We cannot move on with phases if one is not complete. Project manager's responsibilites is to ensure we are on schedule and have a budget amount for project that should be dicussed upfront. 

## Risks
Clients and stakeholders struggle to describe and consider every design requirement upfront, make sure we know what we are trying to do.
Changes to requirements most often have a direct negative impact on delivery, casting blame on whoever overlooked a detail, ensure that we are all on the same page and that every question is answered. 
The process of redesigning, or re-engineering system features can become incredibly expensive so ensure we have "models" and get an approval before continuing.
